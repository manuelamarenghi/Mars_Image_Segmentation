# Mars_Image_Segmentation

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project focuses on **semantic segmentation** of Mars terrain images using deep learning. The goal is to classify pixels into categories like rocks, soil, and other terrain features with high accuracy, measured by mean Intersection Over Union (mean IoU). We explore advanced techniques in data augmentation, neural network architectures, and optimization to achieve state-of-the-art results.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like **general augmentation**, **copy-paste augmentation**, and **compositional image synthesis** to handle class imbalance and dataset limitations.
- **Model Architecture**: A modified **U-Net** architecture with:
  - **Nested U-Net**: Two encode-decode subnetworks for faster training.
  - **Dilated Spatial Pyramid Pooling**: Captures multi-scale features.
  - **Dual Attention Unit**: Improves feature sharing across spatial and channel dimensions.
  - **Transformer Blocks**: Initially used for long-range dependencies but removed due to overfitting.
- **Training**: Optimized with **Adam optimizer**, **sparse categorical cross-entropy loss**, and dynamic learning rate reduction. Early stopping prevents overfitting.

## ðŸ“Š Results

The best performance was achieved using **Dual Attention Unit** and **Dilated Spatial Pyramid Pooling**, with an **Inference Mean IoU** of **69.91**. Below are the results:

| Experiment               | Validation Mean IoU | Inference Mean IoU |
|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Base U-Net               | 43.92               | 42.38              |
| U-Net++                  | 48.04               | 45.63              |
| With Augmentation        | 56.82               | 50.47              |
| With DSPP                | 63.29               | 69.70              |
| With Dual Attention      | 64.90               | 69.91              |
